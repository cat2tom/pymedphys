Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================


I need help, how do I ask a question?
-------------------------------------

If you are having trouble we would be more than happy to help. Please raise an
issue within the `PyMedPhys repo issues section`_ on GitHub. To do this you
will need to make a GitHub account, but this is not too dificult and it will
be worth your while.

This is preferable as opposed to sending an email, as others likely have similar
questions, and that means they might be able to get help from the same answers/guidance
we provide to you.

Also, if you do find a question and answer on GitHub that was helpful to you
it might be worth making a comment that the question and response should belong
within this FAQ document.


How can I report a bug, provide feedback?
-----------------------------------------

You can raise an issue on GitHub within the `PyMedPhys repo issues section`_.
Please use this as opposed to emailing contributors if possible as this means
the reports/questions/feedback is visible by others who potentially have the
same issues or might be able to provide further perspective on the issue.
